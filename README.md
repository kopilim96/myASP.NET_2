# myASP.NET_2
I am still learning the concept behind the ASP.NET after my 1st ASPNET Project
and This is my 2nd ASP.Net Core Project with MVC titled Library Management System

Learning from this Project
 - Entity Framework to deal with Database
 - Linq
 - Deal with different class library
 - A little knowledge of HTML and CSS
 - MSSQL Studio
 
 
 *The CSS Code is pretty messed up bcoz I copy some of the code from Wes and Online Templates..*
 
 * Note1: There will be a lot of improvement to be made such as *
   *- Login/Register Services for Patron*
   *- Admin Service Page -> Admin CRUD Assets and so on*
   *- The Interface and Style of course.*
